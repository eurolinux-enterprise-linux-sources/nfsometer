nfsometer -

  A framework for the running and reporting of performance characteristics of 
  workloads across NFS protocol versions, options and Linux kernels.


About
==================

  author:  Weston Andros Adamson <dros@monkey.org>
  website: http://wiki.linux-nfs.org/wiki/index.php/NFSometer


Dependencies
==================

  nfsometer depends on several third-party packages and will not run without
  them installed.

   - matplotlib - used for graph plotting
   - numpy      - used by matplotlib, stats functions
   - mako       - used for html templating of reports
   - nfs-utils  - mount.nfs, mountstats, etc
   - time       - /bin/time

  On a fedora system the following command will install these packages:

  # sudo yum install python-matplotlib numpy python-mako nfs-utils time

  Other distros will have a similar command.


Installation
================

  nfsometer is designed to be able to run without installation, ie:

  # ./nfsometer.py --help

  nfsometer can also be installed to standard python site-packages and
  executable directories (must be run as root):

  # python setup.py install
  # nfsometer --help


Using nfsometer
=================

 See the nfsometer manpage:

  man nfsometer

 Or use the help:

  ./nfsometer.py --help

 And see examples (the same as in the manpage):

  ./nfsometer.py examples


Adding a workload
======================

  Adding a workload is designed to be very simple.

  Copy the 'nfsometer-workload-template' file to a file in the workloads
  directory that ends with ".nfsometer", edit this file following the
  instructions contained within.

  Most of the time it's probably easier to just use a custom workload -
  see the manpage for more info on the custom workload.
