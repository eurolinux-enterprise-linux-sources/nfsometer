 A lot is missing from this file because the NFSometer.py script is in the 
 process of being completely replaced with a unified web interface.

DATA COLLECTION
 Trace data is collected in a collection of flat files.  Each trace gets it's 
 own directory.  Each trace result directory contians an "arguments" file that 
 has a simple "<key> = <value>" format.

 o always collect the raw, unadulterated source data.  this way, nfsometer 
   bugs can be fixed, and the report can be rebuilt instead of running all
   the tests again

 o ANY changes to the tracedir format need to bump TRACEDIR_VERSION

 o Every new TRACEDIR_VERSION MUST make an upgrade step
